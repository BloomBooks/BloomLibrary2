# the above rules prevent all indexing of the site. They are intended for the non-production
# versions of our site. Our file copying rules on TeamCity for our production build avoid copying
# this file to the production directory.
# NOTE: With the "Disallow" above, we still got warnings from google console saying that they indexed it anyways.
# So we're planning to implement "noindex" in the meta tags, too.
