We are working on the branch "Migration". We are doing a big refactoring, but we should be getting the same results as we had on Master.

The code from Master is available via git worktree, found at C:\dev\BloomLibrary.worktrees\master\.

I have started the server from master on http://localhost:5179/, so you can open the page there and compare html, screenshots, console messages, and network requests using chrome-devtools-mcp.

Now, run your own copy of vite dev server on this current ("Migration") branch, and compare the following page. Compare the page output, the console, if necessary the network log. Find out what we need to fix in our refactoring so that we get the same results as Master.
