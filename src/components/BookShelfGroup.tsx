/* This lets us show bookshelves. Not the books in them, but the list of shelves, themselves.
    It's not obvious that we want/need the current system with bookshelves which live in the database.
    On the one hand, we may find we need to do code work anyhow to do a good job of presenting a shelf,
    so why not just locate it in the code.

    On the other hand, we will eventually need to support user-generated shelves. We may also eventually
    need to support alternate book library sites, and those would be even more driven by database
    instead of code.

    So for the moment, I'm just leaving things as they are. We can query for all bookshelves, but the
    home page will also choose to feature Enabling writers, from code. So it's a mix of approaches
    for now.
